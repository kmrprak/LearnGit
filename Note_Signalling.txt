Signalling Basic:

- Railway Signalling system used to control Railway Traffic Safely

# Control over movement of Trains
	Basically, two types of controls could be catered for
	
1. Time Interval Method

2. Space Interval Method:
->The driver of the approaching train must be able to know whether the next block is not clear, he 
should stop and wait. Here is where "signal" comes in.


#Scope of Signalling system
-Avoid collision and derailment
 Manage safe passenger exchange
 Ensure passenger protection and information
 Drive the train
 Regulate the traffic
 Insert/ remove train from the mainline


#Conclusion
It can be concluded from description of concept of Signalling 
that the main purpose of Railway Signalling Systems is to 
maintain a safe distance between trains on the same track

#Train detection

The presence of a train on a portion of track can be detected by 
track circuits or axle counters and this information is used for 
controlling the signal, which in turn controls the train 
movement

-An Axle Counter System determines the track vacancy; it supplies the information about whether a track in a particular section is clear or occupied,
 thereby permitting safe, trouble-free and efficient operations management of trains.
 
 
 #type of track circuit is used for the Rail and Metro Corridor :
 Track Circuit DC
 Track Circuit SDTC
 Track Circuit CVCM
 Track Circuit HVIT


#POINT

A Point is a mechanical installation enabling trains to be guided 
from one track to another.
A point is constituted of one or two ends.
It is also referred as switch in some countries

#OVERLAP
Overlap is the length of track in advance of a stop signal, which 
must be kept clear for clearing the stop signal next in rear.
An overlap provides protection against the consequences of a train 
overrunning a signal at red


#BRAKING DISTANCE
The distance travelled by a train after its brakes are applied is known as the 
braking distance, and this is an important concept in signalling for determining the signal 
sighting distance

=> Braking distance is a function of speed and other factors, such as the brake power available, 
gradient, rollability of wheels, and the state of rails (wet or dry), curvature of track and velocity 
of wind, etc., which cannot be established very accuratel


#ISOLATION
trap points
safety points
side protection switch (US)

points provided in a line to prevent unauthorised
movements from that line on to another line, and 
which are interlocked to provide flank protection


#Station
STATION means any place on a line at which traffic is dealt with.
Passengers may board and alight from trains and/or goods may be 
loaded or unloaded


#Platform
A railway platform is a section of pathway, alongside rail tracks at a 
train station, at which passengers may board or alight from 
trains.


Track Circuit :
=>How track circuit works in broken rail track ?


Axle Counter :
=>An AC is a system used in railways to detect the "clear" or "occupied" status of a section between two points.

Block system:


================================================================================
 ERTMS-ETCS :
 
The learner will be introduced with the origin of ERTMS-ETCS and the key actors of the associated Normative Framework.

#Track side sub system:

- Eurobalise  ( Transmission device  , Up link , from trackside to on board sub-system)
- Lineside electrical unit
- Radio communication network
- Radio Block center
- Euro loop
- Radio infill unit
- key management center (KMC)
- Public key infrastructure


#Radio Communication network

- GSM-R system
	-Master switch controller
	-Base station Controller
	-Antenna
	
	
	
# On Board sub system:

	- ERTMS/ETCS  on-board eqipment
	- The GSM-R on-board radio system 
		for the bi - directional exchnage of messages between on-board subsystem and RBC( Radio infill unit )
		
		
# ETCS Application level:
	Different levels are available, these level are used depending on track equipment and determine the type of transmission of information.
	
	level 0  => its not equipped with any ETCS , nor with National system ; in this case ETCS onboard sub-system is not responsible for the movement safety. 
	level NTC
	level 1
	level 2
	level 3
